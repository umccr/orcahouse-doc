# dbt Model Guide

dbt ([Data Build Tool](https://www.google.com/search?q=Data+Build+Tool)) Model documentation auto-generated by `dbt docs generate`. 

* The generated dbt doc can visualise data model dependency in Lineage Graph DAG (REF#2). 
* A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a visual representation of data models and their connection to each other.

### TL;DR

* For the selected model, do check out the data lineage graph button in the bottom right corner of the screen.
* It shows the model up/down stream data flow. 
  * e.g., the `hub_sample` shows what sources are, and then the down stream models that flow into...
