# OrcaVault Warehouse 

## Model

- [orcavault_tsa.erd.json](orcavault_tsa.erd.json)
- [orcavault_psa.erd.json](orcavault_psa.erd.json)
- [orcavault_dcl.erd.json](orcavault_dcl.erd.json)
- [orcavault_mart.erd.json](orcavault_mart.erd.json)

## Note

- Read overall [data architecture](../../arch).
- Use the ERD model diagram^^ in conjunction with the [dbt model guide](../../dbt).
- All ERD models are _manually_ authored and documented via [erd-editor tool](..) by the developer.

### README by AI Agent

- As we are developing OrcaVault models and making rapid changes as we go; documentation would quickly outdated by the fast-moving development phases.
- Hence, we provide how to generate README out of the latest data model development by leveraging [AI agent for the documentation](https://www.google.com/search?q=ai+agent+for+coding) job. As follows.

  1. Git clone (or) point AI agent to the source code location `https://github.com/umccr/orcahouse/tree/main/orcavault`
  2. Perform agentic action via the prompt.
    ```
    Go inside to orcavault/models and summarise and generate README file in markdown format.
    ```

- As an example, we provide two autogenerated README by [Amazon Q Developer](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/) and [JetBrains Junie](https://www.jetbrains.com/junie/) agents.  
  - [README__amazon_q.md](README__amazon_q.md)
  - [README__jetbrains_junie.md](README__jetbrains_junie.md)

- We find that the autogenerated README by AI Agent is a good approximation to understand the overall data models being developed. However, any nuance details should be further clarified with the developer.
